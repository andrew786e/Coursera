            &quot; The Girl Scouts is where I became acquainted with the idea that a woman can do anything. 
            Learning that early on has a tremendous impact on the development of a young girl's personality. 
            It had a huge impact on me. Girl Scouts is where I first learned about philanthropy and fell in 
            love with the concept of helping others-in my troop this was very important. We did a lot of community
            service like picking up trash and feeding the homeless. Loving humankind was something that echoed throughout
            my time at&nbsp;Girl&nbsp;Scouts &quot;
